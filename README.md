***Envelope Budget Full-Stack-Webapp***

**Author:** *Bradley J.M.*

This project was completed independently as a challenge to build a full-stack webapp from a scratch. As of 10/11/2021, it is not quite finished yet, the post button does not work yet and the code has not been refactored into routes.

In this project I used Node and Express to create a back-end server. I used and React, HTML, and inline CSS to create the front-end.

The server.js file serves the static files in the public folder and handles all other logic on the back-end. You can launch the app by typing `node server.js` into the terminal. 

I completed this project with 2 goals in mind -- 

1. I wanted to build a full-stack webapp from the ground up -- without using any libraries other than Express, React, and some standard middleware. I wanted to develop a strong understanding of what is happening at each part of a webapp. Every single word of the code in this project aside from the imports was written by me.

2. I wanted to learn more about React and how it functions. To do this I decided to use inline React, inserting React files directly into HTML instead of starting the project with the `npx create-react-app my-app` command. This allowed me to develop an understanding of how React can be added to an existing back-end and learn more about how React functions at a fundamental level.
